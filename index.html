  <h2>Production diary – Week 15</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>

  <p><strong>What did you actually build or change this week?</strong><br>
  This week I created my GitHub Pages portfolio website and added the main sections like About, Projects, Skills, and Contact.</p>

  <p><strong>Which achievement are you most proud of so far on your website?</strong><br>
  I am most proud that I successfully published the website online using GitHub Pages and made the navigation links work.</p>

  <p><strong>What did you find most challenging?</strong><br>
  I found it challenging to understand how to upload files correctly and how committing changes works in GitHub.</p>

  <p><strong>What did you learn about web development or computer science maths from this work?</strong><br>
  I learned how HTML sections and links work, and I learned that GitHub Pages hosts a website from my repository.</p>

  <p><strong>What is one concrete improvement you want to make next week?</strong><br>
  Next week I want to add one complete project card with a title, description, and screenshot, and improve the layout using basic CSS.</p>
